They continue to take the time to get to know us as both individuals and a business, and offer tailored products and services based on our specific needs.

From the outset, their sincere desire to see clients well-protected AND successful has been evident.  Through the years, The Concannon Insurance Agency has made certain that DynaLabs was receiving the most comprehensive coverage at an optimal price.  For example, a couple of years in, Jim brought us a less expensive insurer, but maintained the same level of coverage; practically unheard of in the business landscape today.  This agency is our “Go To” for all things insurance.</em></p>
